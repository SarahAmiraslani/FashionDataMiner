","Acetate is the most toxic semi-synthetic cellulosic fiber due to the extensive use of harsh chemicals during its production.

Deforestation, the removal of trees, causes habitat loss for our precious wildlife and is one of the largest causes of carbon emissions. It's crucial to ensure our forests are responsibly managed, and that our viscose products are sourced from responsible supply chains. 

Most forestland in the US is privately owned, so landowners often clear forests to enter more profitable industries such as farming, housing, or ranching. Acetate rom responsibly sourced forests is typically more expensive, which allows landowners to be compensated fairly and disincentivizes excessive deforestation. "
