When washing synthetic textiles, micro plastics can diffuse into water. Nevertheless we use synthetic materials for hight quality products. This is why: Using recycled PES need much less water in production that other natural materials, it`s a very durable material, it`s functional and as we use it in varietal purity, recyclable. Nevertheless we are aware of the microplatic problem we face. Most micro plastics diffuse into water when washing the product. Our friends from LANGBRETT® have found a solution. The Guppyfriend washing bag is the first pragmatic solution, to filter tiny micro plastic pieces, which dissolve when washing textiles. These pieces can be collected out of the bag after washing and be disposed in regular plastic waste.\nFind more information about the product here: guppyfriend.com']"

The heart of this parka is a warm isolation layer made from high-quality, 100% recycled PrimaLoft® Bio™ filling. We’re proud to be able to use this material for the first time. At the end of its lifespan, it will biodegrade in certain conditions, such as in a landfill or in the ocean. There it is consumed by naturally occurring microbes many times faster than conventional synthetic fibres. This winter coat has numerous pockets to give you plenty of space to carry things and to warm freezing hands. The classic design of this parka is timeless and the deep red colour is easy to pair with your other clothes.']"
