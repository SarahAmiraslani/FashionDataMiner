This wrap was brought to life with the intention of heightening a spontaneous, playful spirit; easing tension; and increasing energy circulation to your center, where your creative instincts live. It is meant to be a warm and vibrant companion guiding you towards embracing both fear and courage. And it is worn to stimulate motivation, endurance, leadership, and purpose. The Carnelian wrap serves as a catalyst to unlock what is already inside of you. And every time it is whisked across your heart and over your shoulder, you are reminded to embrace your fiery intuition. The wrap possesses many beautiful colors up close — yellows, reds, and oranges — and just like a Monet painting, it takes on a whole other feeling once you step back. The combination of color was chosen carefully as color is known to have a great impact on us. Many studies within the field of psychology and color theory have been made to prove so. This particular color is a similar color to the Carnelian stone and has similar qualities to what is described above. Regardless of belief or science or any of the above however, it is the reminder of our thoughts and intentions that possess more power than we know and that in itself can carry us a long way.   M A T E R I A L - V I R G I N  W O O L After a thorough investigation on the sustainability and ethical implications of working with wool, both virgin and recycled, we are so very proud to introduce a virgin wool. Why did we choose wool? Virgin wool is stronger, higher quality, softer, and lasts longer in your wardrobe than recycled wool. It also has an established closed loop recycling route as it is able to be recycled for more utilitarian uses. And even if it is not recycled, it is naturally compostable and biodegradable. It has properties of being both breathable and insulating. It is a natural, hollow fiber that releases any moisture and body odor quickly once it dries. Virgin wool requires less washing and drying — aka energy. The production of wool has a very low environmental impact, especially compared to the production of recycled wool, which has a very high usage of water and energy. We also learned that wool is actually “climate beneficial” and engages in “net negative emissions.” The journal Soil and Water Conservation did a study in 2016 that found that “herds that prune the grasses promotes growth, churns soil with their hooves, and fertilizes it with their feces... the grasslands then rest, grow and suck carbon out (aka an existence of a methane-digesting bacteria) of the atmosphere as the topsoil builds up. Wool producing sheep help in this process.” It is important to note that sheep are not killed for their wool and that our wool was sourced ethically. Sheep do not usually resist the shearing process unless they are frightened by any sudden movements. They are shorn without any existence of harm or trauma. Kind of like us buzzing our head. It is also important to note that the sheep were not mulesed! There are very few negatives to using wool; however for the purpose of a rounded understanding, here they are: if virgin wool is mass produced it may have a negative environmental impact because the amount of feed required for sheep could put a strain on the surrounding ecosystem. The sheep can also degrade soil and cause water pollution if it is mass produced and sheep have to stay in one area. It can also lead to sheep breeders killing “pest” animals such as kangaroos in Australia (the largest maker of wool). So it’s important to know where we source and from whom. The wool we use is ethically sourced from Europe. The wool is dyed with all pertaining procedures respecting the environment by minimizing pollution and safeguarding water resources. The dyes are non-toxic to ensure health, reducing the risk of allergies and diseases (and because duh why use toxic chemicals). Throughout the entire supply chain there is social equity and respect for fundamental rights of the workers as well as recognition of fair wages and environmental conditions.     ',\n",

The mill we chose, Toki Sen, functions on a policy of “symbiosis with nature,” meaning they manufacture with ecological considerations and promotion of oil removal. The mill is a member of BCP (Better Cotton Platform).  They use TSURI knitting machines that move in a slow ticking motion to produce old fashioned, high quality stitches, literally weaving air into the fabric which gives you an incredibly soft and beautiful texture that is impossible to reproduce on modern day machines. This traditional method has been slowly developed over 100+ years with thought and intention and with great attention to detail. Toki Sen uses “fallen cotton” which means they use old clothing such as secondhand  clothing or cutting wastage and return it to a raw cotton form. To do so, they “fluff” the material, meaning a machine breaks the weave of the previously made clothing. The making process of the newly recycled fabric has a very low carbon footprint as the result is a combination of experienced artisan’ skill and the traditional Japanese techniques use and refer to as “slow vintage.” Additionally, a portion of our fabric purchase for the Luna Dress went to Burkina Faso, which contributes to the healthy development of the country through the ethical purchase of cotton grown in Burkina Faso in West Africa. A portion also goes to support medical care and education through the Japan Burkina Faso Friendship Association. Toki Sen is admirably continuing their journey to live in symbiosis with nature.

       " ('The Simone Top is an elegant wrap made versatility in mind. I designed it with a generous full wrap so that you\\'ll feel comfortable and secure. This piece can be reversed, with the V worn in the back and a high scoop front neck. The dolman-cut short sleeve gives slight coverage to the shoulder and arm. The side seam curves in delicately at the waist, where the tie can be styled in either a bow or a knot. If you prefer the look of a defined waist, I highly recommend tucking the Simone into a pair of high waisted pants. It looks stunning! In Raw Silk, the Simone has an easy, soft drape. The characteristic \"nubby\" texture of the silk gives this top a natural feel.  Product Info: Model: Ashley (5\\'10\") wears the Simone Top in size 2XL. with the V in back.

Material and Care  1. Fabric: Lyocell Linen Canvas Fiber Content: 56% Lyocell ; 44% Linen  Description: This Lyocell / Linen blend is the best of both worlds. The Lyocell makes this fabric drape beautifully, while the linen provides structure, texture, and ease. The structure provided by the canvas makes it more substantial for winter compared to our previous tencel fabrics.  Care: Wash cold on delicate cycle and hang dry. The Earth and your garments will thank you!  2. Fabric: Brushed Organic Cotton Twill  Fiber Content: 100% Organic Cotton  Description: Organic cotton is a natural fiber that has minimal environmental impacts. Given its properties, it\\'s easy to love, maintain, and wash. Our medium-weight cotton is brushed on both sides making it feel like fleece.  Care: Preshrunk and machine washable. Wash on normal with cool water. Tumble dry or hang dry (which we prefer).  3. Fabric: Tencel in navy, maroon and black Fiber Content: 100% Tencel Twill in 5.8 oz Description:  A silky fabric that drapes and moves with your body. Made in a medium-weight matte finish, this Tencel has a subtle sheen only visible in light. Due to its weight, it wrinkles less than its lighter counterparts.  Care: Machine washable. Wash on delicate with cool water. Tumble dry on low heat or hang dry (which we prefer).  Tencel wears over time and will fade with repeated washing. If you prefer to maintain its color, we recommend hand washing and do not tumble dry. 4. Fabric: Recycled hemp/organic cotton in grey Fiber Content: 45% Recycled Hemp/Organic Cotton; 35% Hemp; 25% Organic Cotton in 6.7oz Description:  A textured fabric that feels structured, but with a slight stretch. Perfect to wear in pants and jumpsuits, this fabric is substantial without being too bulky for winter. Similar to tweed, this hemp/organic cotton blend has a raised weave, which can feel itchy if you are sensitive. With time and wear, the fiber softens and becomes smoother. All garments are prewashed, which softens the weave.   Care: Machine washable. Wash on delicate with cool water. Tumble dry on low heat or hang dry (which we prefer).
